Bears, Bikers & Mayhem is the first large event in the US to combine the Bear, Leather, Fetish, Motorcycle and Puppy Communities.
Since its inception, BBM has had the singular goal of being an event at which men who enjoy any or all of these communities will feel welcome, meet other likeminded men and, most importantly, have an incredibly fun time. If you are a Bear, you will most definitely find all of the elements of any great bear event. Likewise for Leather men and fetish men – everything you hope to find at any great leather or fetish event is also part of BBM. For many of us, we are a part of several or all of these communities and not just one of them.  The BBM difference is that our fun, food, frivolity & camaraderie also blur the lines between these communities. The Pandemonium Party on  Friday provides an opportunity for the leather and fetish men to welcome the bears to their brand of fun. The Boots to Briefs Party on Saturday is a chance for the bears to show their hospitality. But most of the weekend is a chance for everyone to come together for the common and unifying goal of just simply having a really, really good time and for a good cause.

If you are wondering if you will fit in and have fun at this event, the simple and honest answer is YES! No matter whether you identify with one, all or none of the communities involved, we can almost guarantee that you will have a great time, meet lots of other great men, make new friends and probably consider booking for next year before you leave on Sunday.

As always, BBM raises money for HIV/AIDS and other deserving charities in the region through our own non-profit organization.  Our event lays claim to being the first all inclusive event that includes Bears, Leather Men, Motorcycle enthusiasts, lovers of Fetish/Kink, Puppies and more. Growing every year in activities and attendance, BBM was created to bring all of these separate communities together celebrating each group’s unique interests and perspectives as well as the brotherhood we all share in common.

Your run pass will include up to 7 Meals, awesome entertainment, late night snacks, lots of parties, tons of opportunities to socialize and meet new people, and so much more.

Along with the Mr. Mayhem Leather and Mr. Mayhem Leather Bear contests, BBM is a full weekend of parties and activities that include our expanded vendor market, laser tag, go-carts, mini golf, pool party, cigar party, after-hours parties, plenty of food and much, much more. You will find that our event is highly rated by past attendees with a very high return rate.

With plenty of optional excursions and tours to Historic Gettysburg and the National Battlefield Site you’re guaranteed to have an incredible time.  Please take a look at our events page, so you can get a full snapshot of what we have to offer.
